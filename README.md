## Shakespeare Emotional graph

This is a project that analyses the emotional context of the lines of Shakespeare's play Henry IV, Part 1.<br>
_Please note that the lines in the play are not ordered due to time constraints._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get it up and running, in your terminal, run:
- `npm install` to install all dependancies (only required for the first time you run the project).
- `npm start` to start the sass watcher and to boot up the project.
- To start tests, use `npm tests` in your terminal window.
